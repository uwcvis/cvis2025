intro:
  - excerpt: |
      There has been an astronomical rise in the use of **artificial intelligence, computer vision, and imaging** in modern society. These technologies are now integrated in many diverse aspects of our daily lives and will continue to change the way we see, understand, and interact with the world in the future.
      
      The design of novel imaging instruments and the development of innovative intelligent algorithms for processing and understanding the information captured all around us—as well as making predictions and inferences based on that data—are crucial in further accelerating the prevalence of AI, computer vision, and imaging as enabling technologies in modern life.


      We cordially invite both **academic and industrial research scientists** to attend the **11th Annual Conference on Vision and Intelligent Systems (CVIS 2025)**, where the goal is to bring together both academia and industry to share their joint expertise to promote the advancement and application of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and imaging technologies in various areas of academic and industrial interests.
      

      **Publication:** Accepted papers, if the authors choose to, will be published in a special issue of the *Journal of Computational Vision and Imaging Systems*, the official journal of the KWVIS Society.
      

      **Registration:** CVIS 2025 is **FREE** of charge.


      **For any questions, please send an email to <a href="mailto:cvis.uw@gmail.com">cvis.uw@gmail.com</a>**
