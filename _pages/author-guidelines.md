# Author Guidelines

**Paper formatting**: Papers are limited to four pages, including figures and tables, in the CVIS style. Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed. 

Please download the [CVIS 2025 Author Kit]({{ '/assets/CVIS_2025_Latex_Template.zip' | relative_url }}) for detailed formatting instructions.

Papers that are not properly anonymized, or do not use the template, or have more than four pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review.

**Submission and review process**: CVIS 2025 will be using [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=CVIS/2025/Conference) to manage submissions. Submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned members of the program committee (chairs, and reviewers). The reviews and author responses will never be made public, and we will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process. 

Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline. By submitting a paper to CVIS, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by the OpenReview system to match each manuscript to the best possible chairs and reviewers.

## OpenReview Instructions
CVIS 2025 employs OpenReview as our paper submission and peer review system. To match papers to reviewers (including conflict handling and computation of affinity scores), OpenReview requires carefully populated and up-to-date OpenReview profiles. To this end, we require every author to (1) create and activate an OpenReview profile (if not already existent) and (2) to update the profile with the most recent email addresses, career positions, and publications.

More specifically, we require every author to perform the following steps:

**Step 1**:
Log in to your OpenReview account.

If you do not already have an account, you can sign up [here](https://openreview.net/signup). Please make sure to confirm your email address and to complete the registration to activate the profile. (Detailed instructions for the sign up process can be found [here](https://docs.openreview.net/getting-started/creating-an-openreview-profile/signing-up-for-openreview).)

**Step 2**:
If required, please update the email addresses of your profile. Most importantly, ensure that the email address that receives the paper registration notification is linked to your profile and has been confirmed. (Detailed instructions for adding an email address can be found here.)

Please note: Do not remove old email addresses. Those are used for conflict determination in the review process.

IMPORTANT: All future OpenReview messages will be addressed to your "preferred email" address of your OpenReview profile. Hence, please make sure to adapt the preferred email address of your profile - if required.

**Step 3**:
Please follow the instructions to enter or update the institutional data of your profile.

(If your institution is not part of the drop-down list, you should be able to just enter a new institution domain and name.)

Please note: Do not remove old positions. Those are used for conflict determination in the review process.

**Step 4**:
Please update your list of publications in your profile; see instructions to import papers from DBLP to your profile.

(If you have not published yet, you can skip this step.)   

Please note: The list of papers in your OpenReview profile is shared across conferences, so it should contain all your publications. OpenReview uses this list of papers for conflict determination in the review process.

**Step 5**:
Complete paper submission by the deadline below. To begin the submission process, go to the OpenReview CVIS 2025 submission page, make sure you are logged in, click on the "CVIS 2025 Conference Submission" button, and then follow the instructions on the form that will appear.

# arXiv

 You may optionally publish your paper on Journal of Computational Vision and Imaging Systems (JVIS), the official journal of the KWVIS Society, after the CVIS conference. If you would like to opt out of publication, please contact us before January, 2026. 
 
 <!-- Note that papers longer than 4 pages may violate the dual submission policy of some conferences. In the case that your paper is 5-6 pages, please use the JVIS template (compact template released after CVIS via an email to accepted authors) to check the page length in your camera-ready copy. -->

# Poster Presentation
Accept-poster papers are required to be present in person at **E7 Event Space** on campus of **University of Waterloo**.

*Poster templates will be released soon.*
