      Conformal Prediction: From Images to Agents
    time: Dec 15th 10:00am-11:00pm

      I will introduce and explore conformal prediction (CP) as a flexible framework for quantifying uncertainty and providing statistical guarantees on correctness across diverse machine learning applications. In a nutshell, CP transforms point-predictions into set-predictions, where larger sets indicate greater model uncertainty. CP is a highly practical framework because it is distribution-free, valid in finite samples, and makes very few assumptions about the data or predictor. I will cover how CP can be applied to standard usecases like image classification, including the human aspect of how prediction sets can be used in downstream tasks, then tackle more complex applications based around language models and agentic systems.

  - title: "Artificial Intelligence for Music, from Audio to Video, from Cyber to Physical"
    time: Dec 15th 2:00pm-3:00pm
    abstract: |
      This seminar explores how AI-embedded tools can enhance individual practice and performance for string professionals and students. We discuss requisite technologies such as: audio input analysis, error detection, dynamic and tempo estimation, posture and instrument advising. These capabilities enable AI to provide measurable benefits to musicians and generate genre-specific visual content, addressing two key research questions: (1) When can AI technology improve professional practice and performance? (2) What factors influence musicians' acceptance of AI?
      
      AI has made impressive progress in forms of images, audio, video, and text. AI's future challenges lie in moving from cyberspace to physical space. The second part of this seminar presents a novel MIDI-to-motion conversion for robotic cello performance. This method converts musical input into bowing trajectories without expensive motion capture. Our approach achieves human-like sound and contributes labeled robotic performance data to the research community. To evaluate this method, humans are invited to compare the sound produced by the robot and by humans.

      TRIUMF is Canada’s particle accelerator centre with a rich on-site programme in nuclear physics, particle physics, accelerator physics, material sciences and life sciences. It also serves as Canada’s hub for Canadian scientists to participate in large global science endeavours like these at the CERN’s Large Hadron Collider in Europe or large neutrino Experiments (Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande) in Japan. I will take the audience on a tour, highlighting how applications of modern and traditional Machine Learning enhance science outcomes at the lab. We will also glimpse how quantum computing can be presently utilized to give a us an edge today in select cases.

    abstract: |
      Robotics may be in the spotlight, the real challenge is in building systems that truly work and scale. Ryan has spent the entirety of his professional and volunteer career building and scaling robotics organizations, and he’s learned firsthand what separates fleeting hype from real impact. He’s going to share four things everyone needs to know about successful robot companies, no matter if you're looking to found one or join one. Trends in R&D, product development, sales, and, of course, raising money are all going to be covered. By the end of this talk, you’ll have practical insights to help turn your research and ideas into robots that will make a difference in the real world.
